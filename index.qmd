- Even something as simple as your Facebook "likes" can reveal a lot more than you think...
- Researchers at Cambridge showed that algorithms could predict:
	- Sexual orientation with up to 88% accuracy
	- Race with 95% accuracy
	- Political affiliation with 85% accuracy
- All from analyzing the pages and posts you "liked" (no profile bio or messages needed)!

## What Happens to Your Data?

Every time you use an app, visit a website, click on a link, fill out a survey or even just scroll on your device, your data is being:

:::incremental
- Collected - What you click, search, watch, like or buy  
- Analyzed - Used to predict your behaviour, interests or identity  
- Shared or Sold - Passed to advertisers, data brokers or other companies

## Why Does This Matter?

:::incremental
- You may be targeted with ads, content and potentially misinformation  
- You could be judged or profiled based on your data (even if it’s not accurate) 
- You rarely know who has your data (or what they’re doing with it) 
<br></br>
<br></br>
- So what does this mean for us? Let’s explore how data can be used, what makes certain information sensitive and why it matters.
:::

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

- PII refers to any data that can be used to identify a specific individual.
- Direct identifiers: These clearly and uniquely point to a person.
	- Examples: name, social security number, patient ID
- Indirect identifiers: These don’t identify someone on their own, but could when combined.
	- Examples: age, DOB, postal code, race, sex

## Personal Data

Data can be identifiable when:

:::incremental
- They contain directly identifying information.
- It's possible to single out an individual
- It's possible to infer information about an individual based on information in your dataset
- It's possible to link records relating to an individual.
- De-identification is still reversible.
:::

## Scenario: Can This Data Identify You?

A fitness app shares anonymized data with researchers. The dataset includes:

- Step count per day
- General location (postal code)
- Age 
- Time of day the user exercises
- Health conditions

Separately, a publicly available dataset includes information from a local running club: names, age groups and 5K race times.

## The Mosaic Effect

- The "Mosaic Effect" can happens when separate pieces of data, which alone don’t identify anyone, are combined from different sources to reveal personal information or identify an individual.

- In 2000, 87% of the United States population was found to be identifiable using a combination of their ZIP code, gender and date of birth.

## Pseudonymization and Anonymization

- Pseudonymization and anonymization are techniques to de-identify personal data
- Goal: reduce linkability of data to individuals
- We will now define each of these terms 


## Pseudonymization

::: incremental
- Reduces linkability of data to individuals 
- Data cannot identify individuals *without additional information* 
- Often done by replacing direct identifiers with pseudonyms
- Link between real identifiers and pseudonyms is stored separately
- Re-identification remains possible!
:::


## Anonymization

::: incremental
- Data are anonymized when no individual is identifiable (directly or indirectly)
- This applies even to the data controller
- Fully anonymized data are no longer personal data
- Anonymization is difficult to achieve in practice
:::

## Identifiability Spectrum

- Identifiability is a spectrum 
- More de-identified data = closer to anonymized
- Lower identifiability = lower re-identification risk


![](https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/spectrum_data_privacy_KD.png)

> [https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/08/anonymous-anonymized-data.html](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/08/anonymous-anonymized-data.html)

## When Are Data Truly anonymous?

- Only if re-identification would require *unreasonable effort* (factors include cost, time and available technology)
- Data are not anonymous if:

::: incremental
- Direct identifiers are present
- Individuals can be singled out from a group
- Re-identification possible via linking datasets (mosaic effect)
- Inference about identity is possible (e.g., through different variables)
- De-identification can be reversed
:::


## De-identification Techniques

Techniques to deidentify your data include:

- Suppression
- Generalization
- Replacement
- Top- and bottom coding
- Adding noise
- Permutation


## 

First, let's generate some data we can use to help illustrate these concepts. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

df <- tibble(
  name = c("Joel Miller", "Ellie Williams", "Tommy Miller", "Abby Anderson"),
  age = c(52, 19, 48, 28),
  height_cm = c(182, 160, 185,173) 
)

df
```

## Suppression

::: incremental
- Remove entire variables, values or records
- Used to eliminate highly identifying or unnecessary data
- Examples:
  - Names, contact details, social security numbers
  - GPS metadata, IP addresses, neuroimaging facial features
  - Outliers or unique participants
:::

## Suppression Example

```{r echo=TRUE}
df_suppressed <- df |>
  select(-name)

df_suppressed
```


## Generalization

::: incremental
- Reduces detail or granularity in the data
- Makes individuals harder to single out
- Examples:
  - Convert date of birth to age, or group into ranges
  - Replace address with town or region
  - Recategorize rare labels into “other” or “missing”
  - Abstract people or places in qualitative data (e.g., “Bob” to “[colleague]”)
:::

## 

Here we will show an example of generalization on the `age` column: 

```{r echo=TRUE}
df_generalized <- df |>
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age < 30 ~ "under 30",
    TRUE     ~ "30+"
  ))|>
  select(-age)

df_generalized
```


## Replacement

::: incremental
- Swap identifying info with less informative alternatives
- Examples:
  - Use pseudonyms for names (with securely stored keyfile)
  - Replace with placeholders (e.g., “[redacted]”)
  - Rounding numeric values
:::

## Creating Pseudonyms

::: incremental
- Pseudonyms should reveal nothing about the subject
- Good pseudonyms:
  - Are random or meaningless strings/numbers
  - Are securely managed (e.g., encrypted keyfile)
- Can be generated using tools in Excel, R, Python, SPSS
:::

## Replacement with Pseudonyms

```{r echo=TRUE}
df_pseudonymized <- df |>
  mutate(pseudonym = paste0("ID", row_number())) |>
  select(pseudonym, everything(), -name)

df_pseudonymized
```

## Hashing 

- Hashing converts names into fixed-length, irreversible strings.
- Unlike pseudonyms, hashed values cannot be easily reversed.
- In R, we can use the `digest` package (and function) to hash. 


## 

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(digest) 

df_hashed <- df |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(name_hash = digest(name)) |>
  select(name_hash, everything(), -name)

df_hashed
```


## Top- and Bottom-Coding

::: incremental
- Limits extreme values in quantitative data
- Recode all values above or below a threshold
- Example: all incomes above \$150,000 become \$150,000
- Preserves much of the dataset, but distorts distribution tails
:::

## Top-coding example

- Consider 6ft (182.88cm) is considered our maximum height threshold.

```{r echo=TRUE}
df_top_coded <- df |>
  mutate(height_cm = if_else(height_cm > 182.88, 182.88, height_cm))

df_top_coded
```


## Adding Noise

- Introduces randomness to protect sensitive info
- Examples:
  - Add a small random amount to numeric values
  - Blur images or alter voices

## Adding Noise to Height

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(200) 

df_noisy <- df |>
  mutate(height_cm_noisy = height_cm + rnorm(n(), mean = 0, sd = 2)) |>
	select(-height_cm)

df_noisy
```



## Permutation

::: incremental
- Swap values between individuals
- Makes linking variables across a record more difficult
- Maintains distributions, but breaks correlations
- Can limit the types of analyses possible
:::

## Permutation of Height Values

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(200)

df_permuted <- df |>
  mutate(height_cm_permuted = sample(height_cm)) |>
	select(-height_cm)

df_permuted
```



## Privacy vs. Utility Tradeoff

![](img/privacy-utility.png)

>[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Trade-off-between-privacy-level-and-utility-level-of-data_fig1_357987903](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Trade-off-between-privacy-level-and-utility-level-of-data_fig1_357987903)

## Case Study: Brogan Inc. and NIHB Data

- The Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) database contains sensitive health data on First Nations use of services like prescriptions, dental care, and medical devices.
- In 2001, Health Canada began releasing de-identified NIHB pharmacy claims data to Brogan Inc., a private health consulting firm.
- Though personal identifiers were removed, community identifiers remained, and First Nations were not informed until 2007.
- Brogan sold the data to pharmaceutical companies for commercial research and marketing
- Health Canada justified the release by claiming no privacy interests remained since personally identifying information had been removed.

## Discussion

- Was the data truly de-identified? 
- What are the limits of simply removing names and IDs from a dataset?
- How can we measure whether a dataset is truly “safe” to release?
- Should de-identified data still require community consent before being shared or sold?


## Why basic deidentification isn't always enough

- Individuals can often be re-identified using other information.

- As datasets become more detailed and linkable, privacy risks increase.

- More advanced statistical methods are often needed to ensure meaningful deidentification while preserving data utility.

## Statistical approaches to deidentification 
<br></br>

- $k$-anonymity  
- $l$-diversity  
- Differential privacy (advanced)

## Overview of privacy models

- $k$-anonymity and $l$-diversity are **statistical approaches** that quantify the level of identifiability within a tabular dataset.  
- They focus on how variables combined can lead to identification.  
- These approaches are complementary: a dataset can be simultaneously $k$-anonymous and $l$-diverse, where $k$ and $l$ represent numeric thresholds.
-  $k$-anonymity and $l$-diversityare typically used to de-identify tabular datasets *before* sharing.
- They work best on relatively large datasets, where enough observations are present to preserve useful detail while still protecting privacy.


## Identifiers, Quasi-Identifiers, and Sensitive Attributes

Privacy models distinguish between three types of variables:

- **Identifiers:** Direct identifiers such as names, student numbers, email addresses.  

- **Quasi-Identifiers:**  Indirect identifiers that can lead to identification when combined with other quasi-identifiers or external data.  
	- Examples: age, sex, place of residence, physical characteristics, timestamps, etc.

- **Sensitive Attributes:** Variables of interest that need protection and cannot be altered as they are key outcomes.  
	- Examples: Medical condition, Income, etc.


## Importance of Correct Variable Categorization

:::incremental
- Correctly categorizing variables into identifiers, quasi-identifiers, and sensitive attributes is crucial.  
- This categorization determines how to de-identify your dataset effectively using $k$-anonymity, $l$-diversity, and $t$-closeness.
- Now, let's discuss each of these techniques in detail...
:::

## $k$-anonymity

:::incremental
- A data set is $k$-anonymous if each observation cannot be distinguished from at least $k-1$ other observations based on the quasi-identifiers.  
- This can be achieved through generalization, suppression and sometimes top- or bottom-coding of data values.
- Applying $k$-anonymity makes it more difficult for an attacker to single out or re-identify specific individuals.  
- It also helps reduce the risk of the mosaic effect, where combining data points could lead to identification.
:::

## Making a data set $k$-anonymous

:::incremental
1. Identify variables as identifiers, quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes.  
2. Choose a value for $k$.  
3. Aggregate or transform the data so each combination of quasi-identifiers occurs at least k times.  
:::

## Choosing $k$ 

- There is no single correct value for $k$! 
- Higher $k$ increases privacy, but reduces data detail and utility.  
- The choice depends on promises made to data subjects and acceptable risk levels.

Given the data, which field(s) could you generalize to help achieve **k = 3 anonymity**?

<div style="font-size:0.8em; max-width: 400px; margin: auto;">

| 45  | 14853    | Diabetes  |
| 46  | 14853    | Diabetes  |
| 47  | 14853    | Cancer    |

</div>

- A. Generalize Age into age ranges (e.g., 20–29, 40–49)  
- B. Suppress Disease entirely  
- C. Generalize ZIP Code to first 3 digits (e.g., 130**, 148**)  
- D. Generalize Age into age ranges (e.g., 20–29, 40–49) and ZIP code to first 3 digits (e.g., 130**, 148**)  
- E. It's already $k=3$ anonymous

## $l$-diversity

- $l$-diversity is an extension of $k$-anonymity that ensures sufficient variation in a *sensitive attribute*. 
- This is important because if all individuals within a group share the same sensitive value, there is still a risk of inference.


## 

- Although these data are $2$-anonymous, we can still infer that any 30-39 year old from Calgary who participated earns between 90-99k.

  </tbody>
</table>

## $l$-diversity

- The approach requires at least $l$ different values for the sensitive attribute within each combination of quasi-identifiers.
- Again, there is no perfect value for $l$ (typically $1< l \leq k$).

## 

- With $l=2$, that means that for each combination of Age Range and City, there are at least 2 distinct Salary Ranges.

Consider this 3-anonymous dataset. Is it also 2-diverse with respect to "Condition"?

<div style="font-size:0.8em; max-width: 400px; margin: auto;">

| Age Range | ZIP Prefix | Condition |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 20–29     | 130**      | Flu       |
| 20–29     | 130**      | Flu       |
| 20–29     | 130**      | Flu       |
| 30–39     | 148**      | Cold      |
| 30–39     | 148**      | Cold      |
| 30–39     | 148**      | Cancer    |

</div>

- A. Yes, both groups have 2 or more different values  
- B. No, one group violates l-diversity  
- C. Yes, because the dataset is already k-anonymous  
- D. No, both groups have only one distinct value  



## There are still issues...

- Even though the data is de-identified, some sensitive patterns can still leak through.

- In the example we discussed, both individuals are grouped into the same age range and city.

- While they are in different salary ranges and exact values are hidden, the range is still quite narrow.

- Due to the similarity of the salary ranges, one can still infer that both individuals earn between \$90,000 and \$119,999.

    <tr style="background-color: #FFDDEE"><td>40–49</td><td>Calgary</td><td>110,000–119,999</td></tr>

## Differential privacy

- So, we may need more sophisticated tools to privatize our data...
- Differential privacy is a mathematical approach to protecting privacy
- It ensures algorithm results are nearly the same whether one person’s data is included or not
- Differential privacy makes it hard to tell if any individual’s data is in the dataset, which protects individual's information (even with unusual or unique data)

## Open Science  
<br></br>  

:::incremental  
- **Open science** is about making scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all.  
- It promotes transparency, collaboration, and innovation in research.  
- Includes open access publications, open data and open tools.
- Supported by initiatives like **[FOSTER (Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research)](https://openscience.eu/article/project/foster)**.  
:::  

## What are Open Data?  
<br></br>  

:::incremental  
- **Open data** refers to freely accessible, online data that can be used, reused, and shared with proper attribution given to the original source (FOSTER).
- Sharing and reusing open data helps make research more transparent and reproducible.  
- Ethical considerations mean that not all data can (or should) be fully open (e.g., personal or sensitive data).  
:::  

## Why Open Data Matters  
<br></br>  

:::incremental  
- Reproducibility: Enables verification and replication of research.  
- Efficiency: Saves time and resources by reducing redundant data collection.  
- Collaboration: Allows researchers to combine datasets for new insights.  
- Innovation: Drives new discoveries and applications across disciplines.  
:::  

## Data Ownership & Licensing  
<br></br>  

- Understanding data ownership is essential before sharing or licensing data.  
- Ownership depends on factors like:  
  - Who collected or created the data.  
  - Institutional policies and employment contracts.  
  - Funding agency requirements and agreements.  
  - The nature of the data - personal data may be subject to privacy laws (refer back to the Amazon example).

## Balancing Openness & Ethics  
<br></br>  

:::incremental  
- Open science supports open data whenever ethically appropriate.  
- Some data must remain restricted due to privacy, security, or legal constraints.  
- Best practices help balance openness with responsibility.  
- Open data and open science movements often overlook marginalized individual's rights and interests (e.g., Indigenous data).  
- The goal: "As open as possible, as closed as necessary."
:::  

## Key Takeaways

- Data exists on a spectrum of identifiability 
- Even seemingly anonymous data can often be re-identified (e.g., mosaic effect)
- Quasi-identifiers can lead to re-identification if not protected  
- Choosing privacy parameters involves balancing risk and data utility 
- Responsible data handling requires both technical skill and ethical awareness
